# VinylVault

## Assumptions

- This repository is currently a static web application (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) used to generate record listing drafts.
- The near-term goal is to make the project production-ready without rewriting the UI first.
- Credentialed third-party integrations (Discogs, AI providers, marketplace APIs) should move server-side before launch.

## Scope

This repository now includes a concrete completion plan and security/compliance baseline documents for the next implementation phase:

- Architecture and delivery roadmap.
- Security controls and operational requirements.
- Privacy and data-retention policy baseline.
- STRIDE-oriented threat model.

## Install on your phone

VinylVault is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. You can install it to your phone's home screen for a full-screen, app-like experience with no app store required.

### Android (Chrome)

1. Open the VinylVault URL in **Chrome for Android**.
2. Tap the **⋮ (three-dot) menu** in the top-right corner.
3. Tap **"Add to Home screen"** (or **"Install app"** if Chrome shows a banner at the bottom of the screen).
4. Confirm by tapping **"Add"** or **"Install"** in the dialog.
5. The **VinylVault** icon will appear on your home screen. Tap it to launch the app in full-screen mode.

> **Tip:** If you don't see the option, make sure you are on `https://` — PWA installation requires a secure connection.

### Android (Samsung Internet)

1. Open the VinylVault URL in **Samsung Internet**.
2. Tap the **☰ (hamburger) menu** at the bottom of the screen.
3. Tap **"Add page to"** → **"Home screen"**.
4. Tap **"Add"** to confirm.

### iOS (Safari — iPhone & iPad)

1. Open the VinylVault URL in **Safari** (other iOS browsers cannot install PWAs).
2. Tap the **Share button** (the box with an arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen.
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4. Edit the name if you wish, then tap **"Add"** in the top-right corner.
5. The **VinylVault** icon will appear on your home screen. Tap it to launch in full-screen mode.

> **Note:** iOS requires Safari specifically — Chrome and Firefox on iOS cannot install PWAs.
