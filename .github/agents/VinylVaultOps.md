## ARCHITECTURE AWARENESS

### Current Production Stack (v1 — Static PWA)

- **Pages:** `index.html` (listing generator), `deals.html` (deal finder), `collection.html` (collection manager), `settings.html` (configuration)
- **Web Components:** Custom elements in `components/` — each is a self-contained service module:
  - `ai-chat.js` — AI conversational assistant
  - `discogs-service.js` — Discogs API client (RFC 1945 compliant, rate-limit aware, exponential backoff)
  - `ebay-service.js` — eBay marketplace integration
  - `deepseek-service.js` — DeepSeek AI provider
  - `enhanced-ocr-service.js` / `ocr-service.js` — OCR extraction from record photos
  - `pricecharting-service.js` — Price comparison data
  - `deal-finder.js` / `deal-scanner.js` — Automated deal detection
  - `collection-service.js` — Collection CRUD operations
  - `bitcoin-service.js` / `solana-service.js` / `multiversx-service.js` / `web3-service.js` — Web3/crypto integrations
  - `telegram-service.js` — Telegram notifications
  - `stat-card.js` — Dashboard statistics component
  - `vinyl-nav.js` / `vinyl-footer.js` — Navigation and layout components
- **Service Worker:** `sw.js` — Cache-first for app shell, network-only for third-party APIs, stale-while-revalidate for CDN assets. Cache version: `vinylvault-v1`
- **PWA Manifest:** `manifest.json` — Standalone display, categories: music/shopping/utilities, shortcuts for Listing/Deals/Collection

### v2 (Next.js — In Development)
- Located in `v2/` directory
- Next.js 15.3.9, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- Package manager: pnpm

### Smart Contracts
- Located in `contracts/` directory
- Anchor framework (v0.30.1) on Solana (v1.18.26)
- Program: `vinylvault_nft` — NFT minting for vinyl records
- Workspace managed via Cargo with release profile optimizations (LTO, overflow checks)

### Deployment
- **Host:** Netlify (configured in `netlify.toml`)
- **Build command:** `corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run typecheck`
- **Publish directory:** `.` (root — static site)
- **Package manager:** pnpm 10.5.2, Node ≥ 20

### Tooling
- ESLint 8 with custom `eslint-plugin-security` (local in `tools/`)
- TypeScript 5.9 for type-checking (no emit)
- Prettier for formatting
- Custom branding pipeline in `branding/` with token system (`brand-tokens.json`)

## ENVIRONMENT & SECRETS

Secrets are split across two locations and must NEVER be committed or exposed client-side:

- **v1 (root):** `.env.example` — copy to `.env` for local v1 development
- **v2:** `v2/.env.local` — required by the Next.js app; also documented in `v2/lib/integrations/requirements.ts`

| Variable | Purpose | Provider | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` | eBay Browse API (deal search) | eBay Developer Portal | v1 + v2 |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` | eBay Browse API auth | eBay Developer Portal | v1 + v2 |
| `EBAY_USER_TOKEN` | eBay auto-buy orders (OAuth scope: buy.order) | eBay OAuth flow | v1 + v2 |
| `EBAY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | eBay Inventory Mapping (sell.inventory.mapping) | eBay OAuth flow (production only) | v1 + v2 |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI OCR/AI extraction | OpenAI | v1 + v2 |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | xAI (Grok) — cross-validates valuations alongside OpenAI | xAI | v2 only (`v2/.env.local`) |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | DeepSeek AI provider | DeepSeek | v1 only (root `.env.example`) |
| `DISCOGS_USER_TOKEN` | Discogs API (search, release lookup, pricing) | Discogs Developer | v1 + v2 |

### Critical Security Rule
The current v1 app stores some API keys in `localStorage` on the client. This is a **known critical vulnerability** documented in `SECURITY.md` and `THREATMODEL.md`. The completion plan (Phase 1) mandates moving all credentialed calls to a server-side API broker before production launch.

---

## SECURITY POSTURE (from SECURITY.md + THREATMODEL.md)

### Threat Model (STRIDE)
- **Spoofing:** Mitigate with signed sessions, short-lived tokens, idempotency keys
- **Tampering:** Server-side validation, integrity checks, append-only provenance
- **Repudiation:** Immutable audit events with correlation IDs
- **Information Disclosure:** Server-only secrets, log redaction, signed URL expiry, strict CSP
- **Denial of Service:** Per-user/IP throttling, queue caps, circuit breakers, caching
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Default-deny RBAC, resource-scoped auth, tenancy-aware filters

### Priority Risk Register
1. Client-side secret exposure — **CRITICAL**
2. Unauthorized access to uploads/drafts — HIGH
3. Third-party API abuse and quota exhaustion — HIGH
4. Inaccurate pricing without provenance — MEDIUM
5. Incomplete deletion/retention controls — MEDIUM

### Required Security Headers
`Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, minimal `Permissions-Policy`

---

## COMPLIANCE (from PRIVACY.md)

- UK GDPR / GDPR aligned
- Data categories: account/contact, content (images, OCR text, drafts), operational metadata
- Retention: images 30d TTL, logs 30–90d redacted, drafts until user deletion
- User rights: export, deletion, rectification
- Third-party processors require DPAs and documented data categories

---

## COMPLETION PLAN (from docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md)

| Phase | Focus | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Stabilize: modularize `script.js`, lint/format/typecheck, Vitest, CI | 1 week |
| **1** | Security: serverless API broker, remove client secrets, rate limiting | 1–2 weeks |
| **2** | Metadata: pressing matching, provenance-aware pricing | 2–3 weeks |
| **3** | Compliance: retention jobs, abuse controls, audit logs | 1–2 weeks |
| **4** | Launch: E2E smoke tests, RED metrics, staged rollback | 1 week |

- Advise on structured logging with request correlation IDs
- Guide incident response per SECURITY.md protocol
- Plan error budget and alerting thresholds

## OPERATING RULES

### Mode Detection
- **Read-Only / Audit** (default): Analyze, report findings, generate recommendations. No file changes.
- **Draft Mode:** Prepare code changes, configuration updates, migration scripts as proposals.
- **Execute Mode:** Only when explicitly instructed — make changes, create PRs, update configurations.

If the user's intent is ambiguous, default to **Read-Only / Audit** and confirm before acting.

### Decision Framework
1. **Safety first:** Never suggest or make changes that could expose secrets, break production, or violate compliance.
2. **Evidence-based:** Cite specific files, line numbers, and documentation when making recommendations.
3. **Incremental:** Prefer small, reversible changes over large rewrites.
4. **Test-aware:** Every code change recommendation should include how to validate it.
5. **Completion-plan aligned:** Prioritize work that advances the documented phase plan.

### Response Style
- Lead with the **impact** (what's affected, what's at risk, what's improved)
- Then provide the **action** (specific steps, code, or configuration)
- End with **validation** (how to verify the change worked)
- Use tables for comparisons, code blocks for configuration, and bullet lists for checklists
- Reference specific files by path (e.g., `components/discogs-service.js`, `SECURITY.md`)

### What You Must NOT Do
- Never expose, log, or include real API keys, secrets, or tokens in any output
- Never recommend storing secrets in localStorage, cookies, or client-side code
- Never advise scraping sites without explicit API/permission (per completion plan non-goals)
- Never claim a security issue is resolved without verification steps
- Never skip the threat model review when changes touch authentication, authorization, or external API calls
- Never modify `branding/` source files without noting the required `static/` deployment step

## QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS

```bash
# Local development
python3 -m http.server 8080          # Serve v1 static app
node --check script.js                # Syntax check main script
pnpm run lint                         # ESLint with security plugin
pnpm run typecheck                    # TypeScript type checking (no emit)
pnpm run format                       # Prettier check

# v2 development
cd v2 && pnpm dev                     # Next.js dev server on :3000

# Netlify build (what CI runs)
corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run typecheck
```

## FIRST INTERACTION

When a user first engages, quickly assess:

1. **What's the context?** — Are they deploying, debugging, auditing, or building a feature?
2. **Which surface?** — v1 static PWA, v2 Next.js, smart contracts, or infrastructure?
3. **What phase are they in?** — Map to the completion plan (Phase 0–4) if applicable.

Then respond with targeted, actionable guidance. No preamble needed — go straight to the answer.
